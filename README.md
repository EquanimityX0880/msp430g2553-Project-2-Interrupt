Microprocessors

The four push buttons used in the video are the inputs for the MSP430G2553.

The buttons on the bottom left side of the video are connected to P1.5, P1.6, and P1.7. These buttons use interrupt flags to run a sequence that changes the outputs of P2.0 through P2.7 to subsequently provide power to the LED.
